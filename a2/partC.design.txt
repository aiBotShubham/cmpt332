We have a separate build directory that is architecture specific for each
s-chat executable. The user only needs to run the included s-chat shell script
after building the exectuables. It should work across different architectures.
The user can execute the executables directly from ./build/${OS}${ARCH} if they
don't want to use the script for some reason.
