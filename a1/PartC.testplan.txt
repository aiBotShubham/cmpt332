Our plan for testing part C is to write a test program. The source code is in
the file mytestlist.c

We create 4 lists using ListCreate(). This shows that ListCreate() works.
Then we use list1 as a list of integers. We test ListAdd() by adding an item
into list1. We then check if the item is at the head and if the current item
pointer is pointed to the item. Then we add a second item and check that the
item is the second item in the list.
