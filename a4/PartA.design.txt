Inode Structure:
    - The data inside of our inode is as follows:

    enum filetype type
    data_block_0
    data_block_1
    data_block_2
    data_block_3
    inode* next_free_inode

The point of the inode pointer is to point to the next free inode much like the
way we implemented our list library in A1. This makes it easier to get free
inodes when we need them.
